## Instructions

### Setup Development

To setup the project for development, please follow these steps:

1. Download my project as a [zip](https://github.com/fidellim/Test-Project-1) or clone my repository using this command `git clone https://github.com/fidellim/Test-Project-1.git`
2. Once you are on the directory of the project, install all dependencies:
   1. npm: `npm install`
   2. yarn: `yarn install`
3. After that you can start running the project in development server using this command:
   1. npm: `npm start`
   2. yarn: `yarn start`

### Test Project

If you would like to test the app's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, there is Google Lighthouse.

Follow these steps to check the app's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO:

1. Use Google Chrome (Incognito Mode) to run the app. It is suggested to use Incognito window as Chrome extensions might negatively affect the page's/app's load performance.
2. Make sure the app is running. You can use `npm/yarn start` for now.
3. Once the app is running in Chrome, right click the app and press "Inspect".
4. Locate and press "Lighthouse". It is usually located at the top section of Chrome Dev Tools. <img style="display:block" width="400px" height="auto" src="./src/images/lighthouse_location.png">
5. Then, choose any category that you would want to generate a report. <img style="display:block" width="400px" height="auto" src="./src/images/lighthouse_generate_report.png">
6. After a few seconds, your report will be generated. <img style="display:block" width="400px" height="auto" src="./src/images/lighthouse_data.png">
